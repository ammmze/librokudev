To maintain consistency and readability for all participants, please
maintain the coding standards below:

* All files start with header comment block containing:
  - File name (without .brs)
  - One-line description
  - Copyright
  - LICENSE reference

* All functions have header comment block containing:
  - One-line description

* Type declarations on:
  - Sub/Function parameters
  - Function return values

* Formatting
  - Indent is 1 (real) tab character
  - Space after comma
  - Space after colon, and optionally also before colon
    (e.g. when aligning colons in structure declaration)
    . Special exception: single line structure declaration
      when keys and values are identical and very short, such as
      { x:x, y:y }
  - Space surrounding binary operators
  - Space outside braces, except when used as subscripts
  - Space inside braces when expression is more than one token
  - No spurious comma at end of line in data structure declarations

* Case conventions
  - Camel case class, method, function, and sub names
  - Lowercase keywords / control structures
  - No convention for other cases

* Miscellaneous
  - Use 'sub .. end sub' instead of 'function ... as void ... end function'

* libRokuDev-specific
  - All files, top-level functions, and classes start with 'rd'
  - Method names do not start with 'rd'
  - Any file that requires functionality in other files must declare such in
    a 'Requires:' comment block just under the file header comment block
