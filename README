INTRODUCTION
------------

This is libRokuDev, a community-created library of useful Roku BrightScript
functions and classes.  libRokuDev handles a lot of the busy work so that you
can get on with the more interesting work of building your channel.


INSTALLATION
------------

Installing libRokuDev into your project is simple:

1. Copy the rokudev_files/ directory from the libRokuDev repository
   (in source/librokudev/ ) into your project at the same level as your
   usual images/ and source/ directories.

2. Copy the rokudev_src/ directory from the libRokuDev repository
   (in source/librokudev/source/ ) into your project inside the source/
   directory that contains your BrightScript .brs files.

Thus, your application's final structure should look like this:

    .
    |-- packages
    |-- zips
    `-- source
        `-- YOUR_APP
            |-- rokudev_files
            |   `-- ...
            `-- source
                |-- YOUR.brs
                |-- BRIGHTSCRIPT.brs
                |-- FILES.brs
                |-- ...
